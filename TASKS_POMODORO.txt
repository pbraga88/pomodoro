- Create Repository - OK
	- Add the follow to Readme.md - OK
		Requirements:
		* Use Cortex-M processor
		* Have a button that causes an interrupt
		* Use at least 3 peripherals such as ADC, DAC, PWM LED, SMART LED, LCD, SENSOR, BLE
		* Serial port output
		* Implement and algorithmic piece that makes the system interesting
		* Implement a state machine

		Peripherals/Interfaces:
		* PWM LED x5 (GPIO)
		* Button x2 (GPIO)
		* LCD (?)
		* Speaker (DAC?)
		* Command Line (UART)
		
	- Add white-board picture - OK
	- Create Block Diagram using DrawIO (benchmark SystemDraft) 
	- Create State Machine
		- Excel (benchmark SystemDraft and bear in mind BLE is not covered there)
- Write the Algorithm
	* Use CPP (add good practicies studied)
	- Consider the use of BLE for communication with host
		- Confirm the board has BLE support and whether it's possible to connect with host pc - OK
			* Expansion kit/External BLE module is needed
			* Didn't find anything obvious online
		- Ask in the Making Embedded System Discord - OK
			* Waiting for feedback from Erin [23.11.2022]
		- Buy Adafruit (or Adafruit-like) BLE board
	- Write the sequence diagram
	- Write the algorithm
		* Each peripheral shall have a different class (think about it)
	
- Connect LEDs
	- Toggle LEDs
	
- Connect the buttons (B1 and B2)
	- Turn ON/OFF LEDs on the button press

- Define LCD to use
	- Understand how to use it
	
- Adafruit (or Adafruit-like) BLE
	- Understand how to use it

- Speaker
	* Is it considered DAC? Understand
	- Understand how to use it
	
- Command Line interface over UART
