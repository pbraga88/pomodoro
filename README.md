# Pomodoro
## Requirements:
	* Use Cortex-M processor
	* Have a button that causes an interrupt
    * Use at least 3 peripherals such as ADC, DAC, PWM LED, SMART LED, LCD, SENSOR, BLE
    * Serial port output
    * Implement and algorithmic piece that makes the system interesting
    * Implement a state machine

## Peripherals/Interfaces:
    * PWM LED x5 (GPIO)
    * Button x2 (GPIO)
    * LCD (?)
    * Speaker (DAC?)
    * Command Line (UART)
